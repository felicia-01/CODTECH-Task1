### Objective:
The objective of the Todo List Webpage is to provide a simple and efficient platform for managing daily tasks. By using local storage, the application ensures tasks persist across sessions, allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks without data loss, thereby enhancing productivity.

### Key Activities:
- **Add new tasks:** Users can easily add new tasks to their list.
- **Edit existing tasks:** Tasks can be edited to update details as needed.
- **Delete tasks:** Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Retrieve tasks from local storage:** Ensure tasks are loaded from local storage on page load for continuity.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** The standard markup language used to create the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of the webpage, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **JavaScript:** The programming language used to implement the functionality and interactivity of the todo list.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create reusable components and manage the application's state.
- **Babel:** A JavaScript compiler used to convert modern JavaScript code into a backwards-compatible version for older browsers.
- **Local Storage:** A web storage API used to store task data in the browser, ensuring persistence across sessions.

### Key Insights:
**Component-Based Architecture:** Using React allows for a modular and reusable component structure, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
**State Management:** Efficient state management with React hooks, such as useState, ensures smooth updating and rendering of the user interface.
**Persistence with Local Storage:** Implementing local storage ensures that user data is saved across sessions without requiring a backend, providing a seamless user experience.
**User Experience:** Features like adding, editing, deleting and intuitive task management system.
**Styling with CSS:** Custom CSS provides a visually appealing and responsive design, enhancing the overall user experience.
**Client-Side Rendering:** The application renders efficiently on the client side, reducing server load and providing quicker interactions.

### Target audience:
The Todo List Webpage is designed for individuals seeking a simple and effective way to manage their daily tasks. It caters to students, professionals, and anyone looking to enhance their productivity and organization skills.
